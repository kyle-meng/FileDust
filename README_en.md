# 🌌 FileDust

> *"Where massive data turns into cosmic dust."*

**FileDust** is a zero-footprint decentralized storage engine built for geeks and Web3 believers.

Its core philosophy: Disintegrate your massive files (like gigabyte-sized videos or models) into precise, tiny fragments under `100KB` (Dust). After securing them with military-grade AES-256-GCM local encryption, FileDust scatters these fragments into the Arweave/Irys deep web using concurrency throttling. This elegantly capitalizes on the L2 protocol's underlying subsidies for micro-data uploads.

At this point, you only need to keep a tiny `.dust` file (a few kilobytes) locally, unlocking vast amounts of physical storage space. When you need to reconstruct the data, using your unique password, all fragments will stream back from the decentralized cosmic cloud, strictly verify their integrity, decrypt on-the-fly, and perfectly reconstruct the original massive file!

---

## 🌟 Core Features

- ✂️ **Nano-Precision Chunking**
  Applies a deliberately calculated `90KB` safety threshold by default. It gently slices any massive file into dimensions that perfectly fit the free-tier protocols without wasting a byte.
- 🕰️ **Time-Space Version Travel (CDC Multi-Version Sync)**
  Based on an ultra-fast Content-Defined Chunking algorithm implemented in pure JavaScript! It perfectly supports "incremental deduplication" across multiple versions. For a local modification of a gigabyte-sized file, you only need to upload a few changed fragments in a very short time to complete a brand new cloud mirror backup. Combined with its exclusive `.sync.dust` record table, it supports arbitrary rollback to reconstruct past historical era versions!
- 🛡️ **Military-Grade E2E Invisibility (AES-256-GCM)**
  What enters the blockchain is pure data noise. Not even the gods can piece together or guess your content from the public ledger. By locally generating a high-strength password (Password) combined with a 32-byte random salt (Salt), it derives a 128-byte key, allowing you to rebuild the universe.
- 🌊 **Black-Hole Memory Pipeline (Streaming Reconstruct)**
  A uniquely minimalist pipeline design: `Download one block -> decrypt instantly -> append atomically -> release`. Even when reconstructing a 10GB epic video, Node.js remains absolutely stable, with memory spikes no larger than a mere `2MB`.
- 🚦 **Anti-Ban Camouflage Engine (Ratelimit & Jittering)**
  Built-in `p-limit` concurrent throttling combined with bottom-layer retry backpressure and random Jitter. It interacts gently and with restraint with free-tier nodes (like Irys/Bundlr) to avoid triggering DDoS firewalls and subsequent IP bans.
- 📺 **Star Dust Media Streaming (Dust Browser)**
  An embedded Express local server acts as a frontend rendering proxy. It achieves a true "download-while-watching" streaming experience with multi-instance support and drag-to-seek caching directly from the decentralized chain. Pictures open instantly, videos stream smoothly, elevating the reconstruction experience to cloud-drive standards!

## 🛠️ Installation

Prepare to enter the zero-dimension. Ensure you have the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18 runtime:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/FileDust.git
cd FileDust
npm install
```

*(💡 Upon its first awakening, the engine will thoughtfully generate a `wallet.json` in the directory, allowing seamless mounting to decentralized protocols without complex cross-border configurations.)*

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Command the cosmic sea with just a few lines of code.

### 1. Disintegrate to Dust

```javascript
import { uploadToDust } from "./FileDustUploader.js";

async function makeItDust() {
    // Cast the spell: Local file path, your secret password, and desired chunk size (default safe value is 90KB)
    const manifestPath = await uploadToDust("./videos/secret_movie.mp4", "SuperStrongPassword123!");
    
    console.log(`Generated star map index: ${manifestPath}`);
    // 👋 You can now safely wipe the massive secret_movie.mp4 from your Earthly hard drive.
}
makeItDust();
```

> 🚨 **【ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL SURVIVAL TIP】** 🚨
> Take a look at your current directory—did a file named **`salt.json`** just appear?
> Yes, due to our extremely rigorous encryption standards, your final master key is derived by combining **your Password + this 32-byte random Salt**.
> This means the Salt **is not** exposed in or attached to the headers of the encrypted files stored on the public chain!
> **You MUST store your "password", the "`.dust` star map file", AND the "`salt.json`" file securely together!** Lose your `salt.json`, and even the creator of the universe couldn't piece your data back together, even if you still remember your original password.

### 2. Reconstruct from Dust

```javascript
import { downloadFromDust } from "./FileDustMerger.js";

async function reconstruct() {
    // Feed it the feather-light .dust coordinates, and the galaxy will flow in reverse to rebuild it.
    await downloadFromDust("./videos/secret_movie.mp4.dust", "SuperStrongPassword123!");
    
    // 🎉 Your secret_movie.mp4 descends intact into the current directory.
}
reconstruct();
```

### 3. Chronological Incremental Snapshot Backup (FileDust Sync)

If you have large documents, game saves, databases, or Obsidian notes that need frequent modification, using the dedicated `FileDustSync` can unleash extreme "instant transmission" capabilities and a cross-space-time rollback mechanism:

```javascript
import { syncFileToDust, restoreFileSyncDust } from "./FileDustSync.js";

async function timeTravel() {
    // Create the v1 initial space-time snapshot
    const manifestPath = await syncFileToDust("./my_work.docx", "YourPassword");
    
    // (A few days later) Suppose you only added two lines at the end of the document, backup again!
    // 💥 The extremely furious CDC engine starts! The system instantly checks the history, and the previous parts directly reuse the old network fragments at zero cost!
    // It creates a brand new v2 era snapshot in just a few seconds without wasting data traffic!
    await syncFileToDust("./my_work.docx", "YourPassword");
    
    // Oh no, edited into a mess! Immediately start the time machine and pull the initial v1 version from the star map to the hard drive:
    await restoreFileSyncDust(manifestPath, 1, "YourPassword");
}
timeTravel();
```

### 4. Dust Browser

If your cosmic dust consists of **images**, **videos**, **audio**, or even **Text/Markdown**, you can skip downloading it entirely and spin up a local decentralized browser gateway:

```bash
# Start your local proxy
node DustBrowser.js <Your_Reconstruction_Password>
```

👉 **Once running, visit:** `http://localhost:3000`
The page will mount and render all `*.dust` star maps found in the current directory. Simply click to initiate a multi-threaded "download on the fly, decrypt on the fly, preview on the fly" experience! It also provides a minimalist upload and chunking interface.
